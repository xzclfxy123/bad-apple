# Bad Apple but it's a Windows virus

A high-performance (I've never seen _anything_ like this run in realtime before)
rendition of Bad Apple, using Windows windows as the video surface.

It's not _actually_ a virus, but it is reminiscent of the viruses of old that
were more of a nuisance than anything.

Video demonstration:

## Why is it so performant?

- `DeferWindowPos` - even the most naive of projects can go from 1fps to 15fps
  by using this wonderful batched API instead of `SetWindowPos`.
- `WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW` to remove the taskbar entry
- `SWP_NOREDRAW` when moving/resizing windows
- Optimised code that only shows/hides/moves windows that need
  showing/hiding/moving
- Rust is *blazing fast*, don't you know?

## Could it be faster?

I suspect that choosing which windows to move/resize, such that each is resized
as little as possible, can increase performance - currently, the windows are just
used from largest to smallest, which can result in some location jitter as they
fit into different indexes.

## Future work

All of these I have done already in small tests, but they're both difficult to
make performant (copy dialogs are particularly slow), and difficult to arrange
into a pleasing display.

- Spawning `MessageBoxA` windows and taking their handle (thus avoiding the need
to replicate the layout of `MessageBoxA` for each version of Windows you run
on)
- Spawning Vista file copy dialogs using `IProgressDialog`
- Arranging windows in rolling sine waves, circles, etc

All of these I have not tried yet, but would be great additions:
- Water physics using hundreds of scroll bars
- Basic hard-body physics between windows
- Error noises synced with the audio (could just pre-render...)
- Notification bubbles
- Windows in the taskbar to show text (if the user has large taskbar buttons
  enabled)
- A large variety of error messages to delight the user with

## Building and such

Should be fine to just `cargo build --release`.

Look at `bad apple.py` for the pre-processing to take an input video and turn it
into `boxes.bin`, a space-optimized representation of the window bounds for each
frame. The script is jank, don't come complaining.
